# Simple Shamir's Secret Sharing (s4)

With **S**imple **S**hamir's **S**ecret **S**haring (s4) I want to provide you an easy to use interface for this beautiful little peace of math.</p>

Please note that s4 is provided as it is and I do not take responsibility for any bugs. s4 is a tiny layer around [sharedsecret](https://github.com/posener/sharedsecret) and golangs [AES encryption](https://github.com/gtank/cryptopasta/blob/master/encrypt.go).
